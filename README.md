# aster

`aster` is the canonical public proving-ground destination for `runx`.

The repo itself now carries the operator core:

- constitutional doctrine under `doctrine/`
- mutable current state under `state/`
- append-only public memory under `history/` and `reflections/`
- the separate public face under `site/`
- working docs under `docs/` during migration

The docs in this repo are still about `aster` itself:

- what `aster` is trying to become
- the philosophy that governs how it should behave
- how it should evolve under governance
- which live lanes are real today
- what evidence each lane should emit

The `runx` engine docs still belong in the `runx` repo. `aster` is the
public target, not the place where the framework API and platform model should
be documented.

## Intention

`aster` is meant to become a repo that can improve itself gradually in
public.

The story is not "an autonomous agent that silently rewrites itself."

The story is:

1. `runx` inspects `aster`
2. `runx` proposes bounded changes and public updates
3. humans approve the next safe mutation
4. `aster` improves gradually, with receipts

That means the repo should accumulate a visible evolutionary trail:

- issues that get triaged instead of ignored
- bounded issues that become draft PRs
- PRs that receive operator-grade comments
- new skills that begin as proposals before they become automation
- docs that explain the current system honestly, including its gaps

The governing philosophy is:

- legibility over spectacle
- bounded action over vague autonomy
- receipts over claims
- governed evolution over hidden self-modification

## Live Lanes

`aster` now has seven concrete live lanes:

- `issue-triage`: covers both issue intake and PR review. Issues run through
  `support-triage`, can open `objective-decompose` when planning is approved,
  and only then start one or more repo-scoped `issue-to-pr` workers when build
  is approved. The work issue is the living ledger: trusted maintainer replies
  retrigger the lane, the rolling triage comment updates in place, and PR
  snapshots still run through `github-triage`, pass replay/public gates, and
  publish one high-signal maintainer comment back onto the PR
- `fix-pr`: runs one bounded bugfix request through the governed PR runner,
  validates the target repo with its declared verification profile, reruns from
  trusted replies on `[fix]` work issues, and refreshes a draft `runx/*` PR
  only after that same issue authorizes `fix-pr.publish`
- `docs-pr`: runs one bounded docs or explanation request through the same
  governed PR runner, keeps the request docs-only, reruns from trusted replies
  on `[docs]` work issues, and refreshes a draft `runx/*` PR only after that
  same issue authorizes `docs-pr.publish`
- `skill-lab`: a skill proposal issue runs through
  `objective-to-skill`, materializes a proposal in `docs/skill-proposals/`,
  keeps one rolling machine comment attached to the same issue ledger, and
  refreshes one draft PR only after the same work issue authorizes
  `skill-lab.publish`
- `skill-upstream`: prepares and validates a portable upstream `SKILL.md`
  contribution packet, reruns from trusted replies on `[upstream]` work
  issues, keeps the proposal state on one work issue ledger, and can open a
  draft PR against the target repo only after that same thread authorizes
  `skill-upstream.publish`
- `merge-watch`: observes upstream contribution state and emits public proof
  when the status changes
- `proving-ground`: keeps a draft-first receipt trail for the broader catalog

Support workflows stay valuable even when the external caller is offline:

- `site-pages`: builds and deploys `aster.runx.ai` from repo-owned operator
  content
- `generated-pr-policy`: enforces draft-only plus human-review policy on
  generated `runx/*` PRs
- `rollback`: posts corrective comments or closes generated PRs when a public
  output needs to be superseded

## Required Secrets

`aster` needs only a small hosted secret surface:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: external caller for `runx` `agent-step` boundaries
- `RUNX_CALLER_MODEL` (optional): pinned model override for the hosted bridge
- `RUNX_REF` (repo variable): optional `runx` branch or tag for hosted
  checkouts; defaults to `main`
- `RUNX_REPOSITORY_PAT` (optional): GitHub token for private `runx` checkout
  and other cross-repo automation. The repo-scoped `github.token` is enough
  for same-repo workers; fanout into other repos needs broader access.

Without `OPENAI_API_KEY`, the mutation-capable lanes stay intentionally idle and
the draft-first observability lanes continue to run.

## Local Validation

For the public face and repo-owned operator state:

```bash
npm run check
npm run shakeout:local
npm --prefix site install
npm run site:build
```

If you are touching the optional working-docs surface as well:

```bash
npm run docs:build
```

Run the live proving-ground lane locally from this repo:

```bash
RUNX_ROOT=/home/kam/dev/runx bash scripts/proving-ground.sh
node scripts/summarize-proving-ground.mjs .artifacts/proving-ground
```

Run a real `runx` lane through the external caller bridge:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=... \
RUNX_ROOT=/home/kam/dev/runx \
node scripts/runx-agent-bridge.mjs \
  --runx-root /home/kam/dev/runx \
  --receipt-dir .artifacts/issue-triage/manual \
  -- \
  skill /home/kam/dev/runx/oss/skills/support-triage \
  --title "Example bounded issue" \
  --body "Describe the concrete repo problem here." \
  --source github_issue \
  --source_id 1 \
  --source_url https://github.com/nilstate/aster/issues/1
```

If you have prerecorded caller answers for a given proving-ground run, place
one JSON file per run name in `$RUNX_ANSWERS_DIR`:

```text
$RUNX_ANSWERS_DIR/
  evolve-introspect.json
  sourcey.json
  content-pipeline.json
```

The script will pick those up automatically and continue past the normal
`needs_resolution` boundary for that run.
