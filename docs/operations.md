# Operations

## Required secrets

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: external caller for `runx` `agent-step` requests
- `ASTER_GH_TOKEN`: preferred GitHub token for public outbound comments and
  PRs when those actions should appear as `@auscaster` / Kam rather than as the
  default workflow token
- `RUNX_CALLER_MODEL` (optional repo variable): pinned model snapshot for the
  hosted bridge
- `RUNX_CALLER_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (optional repo variable): retry budget for one
  hosted caller resolution request before the lane fails closed
- `RUNX_CALLER_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` (optional repo variable): per-request
  timeout for external caller model invocations. Hosted workflows default to
  `300000` so stuck cognitive work fails boundedly instead of occupying a
  runner for twenty minutes
- `RUNX_REPOSITORY_PAT` (optional secret): GitHub token for private `runx`
  checkout and other cross-repo automation that cannot rely on the default
  workflow token
- `UPSTREAM_CONTRIBUTION_TOKEN` (optional secret): preferred token for
  cross-repo `skill-upstream` PRs when the default workflow token cannot
  write to the target repo. This should be an `auscaster` token when outbound
  upstream PRs should be authored and opened as `@auscaster`.

## Planned Hosted Memory Access

`aster` should not use a broad shared `RUNX_API_KEY` for memory access.

The planned model is:

- one dedicated `runx` service principal for `aster`
- preferred authentication via GitHub OIDC exchange for short-lived tokens
- rotated service token fallback only when OIDC is unavailable
- narrow scopes such as `memory:read`, `memory:write`, `memory:query`,
  `memory:snapshot:publish`, and `receipt:read`
- namespace ACLs that restrict the principal to aster-owned namespaces

The public site must not use privileged memory credentials from the browser.
It should read public receipts, published public snapshots, or build-time
exports only.

The intended public face is `site/`, not a Sourcey docs surface.

## Public identity

The public interaction model is:

- `aster` thinks backstage
- Kam speaks on GitHub

This means:

- public issue comments, PR comments, reviews, issues, and PRs should read as
  Kam's accountable voice
- internal branding like `Aster triage` is not part of the intended public
  surface
- internal nouns like `lane`, `receipt`, `evidence projection`, and `workflow`
  should stay out of ordinary GitHub conversation
- if an outbound action does not feel good as a permanent statement from Kam,
  the workflow should choose `no_op`

This is constitutional rather than cosmetic. `doctrine/VOICE.md` and
`doctrine/CONDUCT.md` define the public bar; `state/selection-policy.json`
holds the tunable mechanical thresholds that help the operator choose `no_op`
when the bar is not met.

Minimal disclosure is allowed only when it is materially useful, for example:

- `Drafted with tooling, reviewed by Kam.`

## Thread Teaching Policy

Thread teaching is the canonical human-teaching layer:

- `issue-triage` comments first; `work-plan` may run when thread
  teaching authorizes planning, and repo-scoped `issue-to-pr` workers start only
  when thread teaching authorizes bounded build work
- the work issue is the living ledger for one unit of work: the initial request,
  maintainer amendments, machine status comments, and issue-scoped teaching all
  belong in that same thread
- trusted maintainer replies on a work issue retrigger the owning lane
  (`issue-triage`, `skill-lab`, `fix-pr`, `docs-pr`, or `skill-upstream`);
  bots and untrusted stranger comments do not
- the live lane input is the issue-ledger packet, not only the original issue
  body, so amendments change both runtime context and replay fingerprints
- issue and PR replay guards block duplicate reruns before public comments are
  regenerated or reposted
- public comment quality must clear the Kam-voice bar before posting
- issue triage writes comments only through the dedicated workflow
- work-specific approval or teaching lives as a comment on the same work issue
- docs PRs, fix PRs, skill-lab draft PR publication, and upstream skill
  publication still require explicit publish authorization in thread teaching
- dedicated `[fix]`, `[docs]`, and `[upstream]` work issues now start their own
  governed lanes directly instead of sending maintainers back to manual
  workflow dispatch as the normal entry path
- skill-lab opens draft PRs only after `skill-lab.publish` is authorized
- skill-upstream opens draft PRs only, and upstream changes stay limited to
  portable `SKILL.md` unless a maintainer explicitly authorizes more
- generated PR policy enforcement keeps `runx/*` PRs draft-only and explicitly
  human-reviewed
- `evidence-projection-derive` is now the only repo-owned evidence projection surface:
  it rebuilds `state/evidence-projections.json` from uploaded workflow
  artifacts, suppresses repeated retries onto one latest projection per bounded
  objective, promotes only durable or teaching-bearing rows into `history/`,
  `reflections/`, and target dossier outcomes, and updates one rolling draft PR
  instead of opening one PR per triage event
- the rolling projection branch is reset from `main` and rebuilt on every derive
  run; the PR body and derive artifact bundle carry a latest-batch summary so
  reviewers can inspect the current pass directly
- generic low-signal completions remain in `state/evidence-projections.json`
  for runtime context and training instead of inflating public markdown surfaces
- if a derive run only compacts `state/evidence-projections.json` and produces
  zero public projection deltas, the rolling PR is treated as a semantic noop
  and closed instead of reopening for learned-state-only churn
- merge-watch is read-only against upstream repos. It records PR state, checks,
  merge commit, and upstream blob metadata, then emits an internal
  registry-binding request after merge

### Maintainer Thread Teaching Record

When a maintainer wants to teach or authorize future work without hiding that
guidance in prompt sprawl, the instruction should live in the issue or PR
thread itself. For ordinary unit-of-work flow, that means replying on the same
work issue. The richest form is the canonical block:

```md
<!-- aster:thread-teaching-record -->
Kind: publish_authorization
Summary: One bounded docs PR may be published for this repo.
Recorded By: kam
Target Repo: nilstate/runx
Subject Locator: nilstate/runx
Objective Fingerprint: issue:runx-42
Applies To: docs-pr.publish
Invariant: Keep the change docs-only.
Note: Reuse this only for the same repo-scoped objective.
Decision: docs-pr.publish = allow | draft publication is approved
```

Trusted maintainers do not need the full marker block for routine gate updates.
These shorter forms are accepted too:

```md
Applies To: skill-lab.publish
Decision: skill-lab.publish = allow | refresh one draft PR from this same work ledger
```

```md
Kind: lesson
Summary: Keep the work issue as the living ledger.
Target Repo: nilstate/runx
```

Supported `Kind` values:

- `approval`
- `lesson`
- `target_norm`
- `selection_feedback`
- `publish_authorization`
- `memory_correction`

Rules:

- only trusted maintainer authorships count: `OWNER`, `MEMBER`, or
  `COLLABORATOR`
- the thread comment is canonical evidence; derived memory and runtime context
  must be rebuildable from it
- `Applies To` scopes a record to one or more gate ids or wildcard patterns
  such as `issue-triage.*`
- `Decision` captures explicit allow or deny outcomes for concrete gates
- `Objective Fingerprint` narrows a record to one concrete issue or PR objective
- `Expires After` lets old teaching fail closed instead of lingering forever
- `memory_correction` can supersede earlier record ids without mutating history
- if no trusted record exists, the lane behaves as though no thread teaching was
  supplied
- `state/thread-teaching.json` is a rebuildable cache for runtime context and
  training, not a hidden source of authority

## Artifact policy

Every mutating or public lane uploads:

- the final `runx` JSON result
- the receipts directory
- provider traces for each `agent-step`
- live caller-state files in `provider-trace/latest.json` plus one
  `provider-trace/*-live.json` per active request when hosted cognitive work is
  in flight

That makes failures diagnosable and keeps the trust boundary visible.

## Execution Hardening Contract

These are no longer undefined gaps. They are explicit execution requirements.

### Provider auth and key rotation

- hosted memory and other runx control-plane access should prefer OIDC-issued
  short-lived service-principal tokens
- rotated static service tokens are fallback only
- no human refresh token or broad shared admin key is allowed in automation
- provider-facing secrets should have rotation playbooks before lanes widen

### Eval gates

- mutating PR lanes stay draft-first by default
- public-comment lanes should record usefulness and correctness evals
- public-comment lanes should also reject robotic, process-heavy, or bot-branded
  copy before posting
- spam or minimized public comments are severe failures: remove or correct the comment, emit a reflection, update target memory, and apply a long cooldown before similar actions
- authority only widens when eval quality is stable and reflected in receipts
- generated PR lanes should record a change-surface policy alongside publication
  so reviewers can see whether the run touched doctrine, learned state, public
  memory, public face, docs, or runtime code
- on `aster` itself, doctrine writes remain human-only and learned/public
  memory writes belong to dedicated promotion flows rather than general PR lanes
- hosted caller steps should also carry explicit workflow timeouts so a stalled
  provider request fails closed and still leaves uploadable diagnostics

### Merge and rollback

- generated PRs are draft by default unless an explicit lane policy says
  otherwise
- merge remains human-reviewed until a separate policy says otherwise
- rollback happens through the dedicated `rollback` workflow, which posts a new
  corrective PR comment or closes a generated PR, never by pretending the
  original mutation did not occur
- every rollback or correction should emit a reflection and a history entry when
  publicly relevant

### Persistent tracking

- upstream contribution state should graduate from artifact-only packets into
  `state/` projections backed by receipts
- hosted receipt indexing and generic memory should make artifact retrieval and
  replay queryable beyond raw workflow bundles

### Readiness rule

Execution may start once:

- the plan/spec layer is closed
- every lane has an approval mode and memory effect
- public surfaces render only promoted or published data
- memory access is principal-scoped rather than key-shared
