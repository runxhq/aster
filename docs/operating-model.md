# Operating Model

`aster` is the public repo that `runx` should improve gradually over time.

The governing rule is simple: recommendation first, mutation second.

Another rule is just as important: triage before execution.

Issues should not jump straight into mutation. They should first become a
public triage artifact with a suggested reply, a rationale, and one explicit
next lane.

A third rule is what keeps the repo credible over time: capability should grow
by becoming more explicit.

If the system needs more sophistication, that should show up as better docs,
sharper skill context, stronger typed packets, and clearer thread teaching, not
as more hidden magic.

One terminology rule follows from that:

- issue and PR threads are canonical human-authored evidence
- derived memory or policy state is a projection over that evidence
- the projection must stay rebuildable and reviewable

## Boundary

`runx` is the governed runtime. `aster` is a separate operator that uses
that runtime.

That means:

- `runx` owns the product nouns: skills, skill chains, receipts, subject
  memory, subject outbox, and journal
- `aster` runs selected runx skills and chains as live lanes against real repo
  work
- `runx` may own generic primitives such as receipts, evidence indexes,
  artifacts, and generic memory
- `aster` owns operator semantics such as priorities, targets,
  reflections, and public narrative
- provider-thread evidence belongs at the `runx` boundary as a generic evidence
  family; `aster` owns the thread-teaching and work-ledger semantics it
  projects from that evidence

If a concept would only make sense for `aster`, it should not become a
`runx` product noun.

## Phases

### 1. Observe

`runx` reads the real repo and emits typed artifacts:

- repo introspection
- docs-site discovery
- operator update drafts
- skill trust reports

At this phase, `aster` is only collecting signal.

### 2. Propose

The next layer turns those observations into bounded proposals:

- one evolve objective
- one docs-site plan
- one operator update draft
- one trust report or safety note

Every proposal must fit in a receipt and be reviewable by a human.

That proposal layer now has explicit runx capability front doors:

- `request-triage` for issues
- `issue-triage` for PRs
- `design-skill` for new capability proposals

This proposal phase is where `aster` defends itself against vague
automation. If a task cannot be expressed as a bounded proposal with a clear
artifact, the repo should not pretend it is ready for automatic execution.

### 3. Approve

Public or mutating work stays gated:

- repo writes require explicit thread-teaching authorization
- public posts require explicit thread-teaching authorization
- PR creation requires explicit thread-teaching authorization

In practice, `aster` uses three gate shapes:

1. issue or PR intake plus triage: the repo gets a public, typed routing
   decision before mutation
2. workflow-level gate: only specific workflows resolve named `runx` gates from
   trusted thread-teaching records
3. PR review: the generated branch still lands through normal GitHub review

This repo exists to prove governed automation, not to bypass it.

Thread teaching should therefore remain meaningful. The system should not
dilute human review into a ceremonial checkbox after the fact.

### 4. Apply

Once the repo and hosted control plane are ready, `aster` graduates from
draft-only to bounded local patches and then to PR publication.

That progression should be gradual:

1. introspection and draft packets
2. patch plans with thread-teaching authorization
3. local patch application in isolated branches
4. PR publication after review

`aster` now uses that progression concretely through runx skills, chains, and
lane policy:

- `site-pages` publishes the public site from committed repo-owned operator
  content
- `issue-triage` turns a work issue into a public triage artifact, keeps one
  rolling triage comment in that same thread, reruns when trusted maintainer
  replies amend the issue ledger, then runs `work-plan` when the gate
  approves planning, and only starts an `issue-to-pr` worker when the gate
  approves bounded build work
- `issue-triage` comments on open PRs with a runx-authored maintainer response
  only after replay and public-value gates pass
- `issue-triage` and `skill-lab` emit canonical promotion packets inside
  uploaded workflow artifacts rather than mutating repo-owned memory directly
- `skill-lab` follows the same one-thread model: the work issue is the living
  ledger for skill proposal work, and trusted maintainer replies become
  maintainer amendments that retrigger the lane. The proposal draft PR is
  refreshed from that work ledger only after the same thread authorizes
  `skill-lab.publish`, and one rolling machine comment stays attached to the issue
- `fix-pr`, `docs-pr`, and `skill-upstream` follow that same one-thread model:
  the work issue carries the initial request, maintainer amendments, publish
  authorization, and rolling machine status while the lane refreshes one draft
  PR from that ledger
- `evidence-projection-derive` rebuilds `state/evidence-projections.json` from
  those artifacts, suppresses repeated retries onto one latest projection per
  bounded objective, and promotes only durable or teaching-bearing records into
  repo-owned `history/`, `reflections/`, and target dossier outcomes while
  keeping that work on one rolling draft PR with a current latest-batch summary
- generated derived-state refresh PRs are review surfaces and are not fed back
  into PR-mode `issue-triage`
- `fix-pr` turns one bounded bugfix request into a verified draft PR through
  the governed PR runner
- `docs-pr` turns one bounded explanation or docs request into a docs-only
  verified draft PR through the same governed path
- `skill-lab` turns a skill proposal issue into a concrete skill-design PR
- `generated-pr-policy` keeps generated PRs draft-only and explicitly
  human-reviewed
- `rollback` provides a corrective public path when a generated comment or PR
  must be superseded

The key test at this phase is not only "did the run finish." The real test is
"did the repo end up with a public artifact that a maintainer would actually
want to inspect and use."

## Safety Defaults

- one run should end in a bounded artifact
- every mutating step should be visible in receipts
- external claims should stay grounded in repo evidence unless a research source
  is explicitly supplied
- thread teaching should remain first-class and human-visible
- repo identity docs should describe the real current stage, not an aspirational
  future as if it already exists
- repeated failure modes should feed skill or context hardening, not endless
  blind retries

## Memory And Context

`aster` should grow memory in layers.

- first: repo files, receipts, and artifacts
- next: append-only journals, reflections, and target dossiers
- later: derived context indexes and compact summaries
- later still: a generic hosted memory substrate if retrieval pressure justifies it

The important rule is that receipts stay canonical. Derived context is allowed
to help the next run, but it must stay rebuildable from evidence.

The concrete mechanism for that is thread teaching plus the work-issue ledger:
issues and PR threads are the canonical human-authored provider-thread evidence
layer, while the live issue-ledger packet is the bounded runtime snapshot used
for one run, `state/thread-teaching.json` is a rebuildable derived cache and
policy/context projection for runtime context and training, and uploaded
workflow artifacts remain the canonical machine evidence. Repo-owned public
memory now follows the same pattern: `state/evidence-projections.json` holds
the broad runtime and training projection derived from that evidence, while
`history/`, `reflections/`, and target outcome summaries remain the compact
durable subset worth public review.

## Remaining Gap

One explicit operational gap remains:

- model-provider secret management and rotation
